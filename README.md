# PyBank

PyBank is a python script automates the analysis of financial records and present a summary and some basic metrics :

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

for the script to work you will need to have a csv file in the /Resources folder named budget_data.csv with two columns ( date , Profit/Losses )
