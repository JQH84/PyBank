# PyBank

PyBank is a python script automates the analysis of financial records and present a summary and some basic metrics :

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

for the script to work you will need to have a csv file in the /Resources folder named budget_data.csv with two columns ( date , Profit/Losses )

Below is an example of the output of this program
